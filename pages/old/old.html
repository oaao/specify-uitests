                <p>
                    You manage to find a real banger that gets you all fired up, so you <span>dive into Spotify</span> to spin up a
                    related radio station based on the song you're obsessed with, <span>hoping to keep the deafening beat going.</span> Too often, you <span>instead</span> become a
                    bystander to <span>a sloppy and meager parade of tracks</span> which are at best <a href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy">an approximation</a> of what you
                    actually wanted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span>Specify solves this frustration by giving you more precision over musical attributes</span>
                    present in the songs recommended to you by the Spotify engine.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span>Feed it</span> between 1 and 5 songs, artists, or genres to start things off, and
                    <span>freely tweak musical parameters</span> on sliding scales: simple and definite things like
                    <span>tempo, key</span>, and mode; aspects of <span>tone and temperament</span> like
                    acoustic/electronic, instrumental/vocal, live/recorded, dancey/mellow, melancholy/cheery; and
                    other things you might care about such as <span>higher or lower popularity.</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    You'll receive a playlist of <span>up to 100 tracks</span> which you can play in-browser or save to your Spotify
                    account - and find it that much easier to <span>always scratch a sound itch whenever it pops up</span>.
                </p>
